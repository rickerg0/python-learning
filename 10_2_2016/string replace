One thing that is really useful is to be able to replace something in a string

Python offers replace(old, new, max)  
old: thing I want replaced
new: what I want it repalce with
max: how many items I want replaced. !!this is not required. If not included then all items will be replaced


str = "this is string example....wow!!! this is really string";
print str.replace("is", "was")
print str.replace("is", "was", 3)



thwas was string example....wow!!! thwas was really string   << notice what happened to the the word "this"
thwas was string example....wow!!! thwas is really string


Try this with other strings.

date  12/03/2013  convert to 12-03-2013

phone 207-555-1212  convert to 207 555-1212  hint use max value!
