PyGame needs to be added to Python. 

1. open a command(dos) window( the black window were you can type)
     start->run->cmd.exe
2. type python <return>


You should see:
Python 2.7 (r27:82525, Jul  4 2010, 07:43:08) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

this tells you that you have  version 2.7 64 bit. If if says 2.7  32bit you will need a different file.

I have included the .whl file for pygame. The whl file is another python installer that sometimes people use.

download the file somewhere. in the command window enter cd < path to downloaded file>

type:
   dir

you should see the file   pygame-1.9.2b1-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl

type:
   pip install pygame-1.9.2b1-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl
   
   sometimes you will see an error about pip not being the latest(need to update) or is not installed.
   
   if pip is not installed...ugh

   this will tell you how to do it
   
   after this you will have pygame installed. I found another useful package, pygButton. 
   
   pygbutton_master.zip - download this file as well
   
   unzip the file somewhere. I created a folder  pygbutton_master and unzipped it there.
   
   there will be a file named setup.py which you need to run
   
   setup.py install
   
   to check this is done open file explore and go to  where you have Python 27 installed. For me it is in C:\Python27
   
   you should find 
   C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\py2neo-2.0.9-py2.7.egg-info
   
   and
   C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\pygame-1.9.2b1.dist-info
   
   yeah!  now to testing
